           The paper was launched on 23 January 1988 by Bal Thackeray, the founder of the Shiv Sena, a local, regional and language driven; political party; in the Indian state of Maharashtra. A Hindi version of the paper, Dopahar Ka Saamana popularly known as Hindi Saamana, was launched on 23 February 1993.

        </h1>
        <p class="mt-2">
           Firstpost attributes the founding of Saamana to Thackeray's dissatisfaction about the amount of press he and his party received in other news outlets. It has been described it as a mouthpiece of the Shiv Sena, providing a link to Thackeray that did not exist previously. Firstpost also reports that while other newspapers allowed bias to creep into their news coverage, Saamana provided relatively unbiased news coverage of government policy and civic matters. It was only news about the Shiv Sena that was biased
